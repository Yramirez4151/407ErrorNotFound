# REPOP APP

## Introduction:

Given the opportunity to create an application that has a positive impact on the environment, our group decided to design and implement an application that would respond to a huge industry that has negative effects on the planet. Currently, the fashion industry is a huge contributor to pollution through water pollution, waste accumulation, rainforest destruction, greenhouse gases emissions, microfibers in the ocean, and much more. There are 1.5 trillion liters of water that are used by the fashion industry each year. Furthermore, 200 tons of water are needed to dye at least one ton of fabric. Clearly, there has to be a better way to produce clothing.

  

## Objective:

Through Repop, our goal is that users either invest in clothing that is environmentally friendly or reuse clothing. Currently a lot of excess clothing is thrown away where millions of tons of textile end up in landfills. We believe that with the use of Repop people would be more motivated to invest in clothing from the right places and share clothing with each other. A great way to get rid of clothes is to have someone else use it in some way. Repop potentially allows users to communicate with each other and trade clothing.

  

## Incentive:

We decided to build an application that addresses the environmental effects the fashion industry has because of how often it is overlooked. Due to fast fashion, people are always buying new clothes much more often since the clothes they buy are not meant to last very long. With this trend growing, especially among the youth, it is important to us that other options are also brought into the picture. We want to lead the users to environmentally friendly clothing that is affordable. We believe that this application can always grow with new features that will make it more user friendly but our idea is to connect people with each other so that they can trade clothing and sell amongst themselves through Repop.

  

## Challenges:

Creating this application throughout this SEEDS program has been a great opportunity for all of us to learn more about mobile development. However, we did face many challenges in creating the app we could with the time given. Our biggest challenge was working with a language that none of us had worked with before, Kotlin. It was often hard to find tutorials on features we wanted to implement in Kotlin due to it being a newer language. We faced some challenges with merging all of our code together since we all were working on the same content and repository. The majority of our technical difficulties were through implementing features in our application. With the time constraint, we had to unfortunately scratch out some desired features. However, these features can be implemented in the future when we decide to take our application a step further.
